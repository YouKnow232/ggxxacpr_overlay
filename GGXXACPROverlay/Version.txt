# 1.1-beta
- Fixed a crash that would occur when the overlay is launched before the game has loaded any characters
- Fixed Hitboxes drawing 1 screen px too thick
- Fixed Hitboxes being drawn 8 game pixels too high
- Fixed Hitboxes that were incorrectly scaled (e.g. Justice's nukes)
- Fixed Hitboxes that were incorrectly displayed during strike invuln
- Fixed Axl parry mistakenly being marked as in parry state for it's full animation. (He seems to be a unique exception for the prior parry detection logic)
- Fixed Jam parry extending parry frames past it's actual active window. (She has a unique variable for her parry. 8F active, 14F parry miss lockout)
- Changed the method for calculating startup to use the player's animation counter (startup calculation is still a WIP).
	- Some moves transition through multiple move IDs internally (thus restarting their animation counter) so it's not 100% correct yet, but this should be consistent and handle gatlings much better
	- The fundamental issue is gatlings can look identical to certain multihit moves with the information I currently have available.
- Changed FRC windows to draw a yellow line on top of the frame meter pip so as not to draw over invuln properties
- Added Throw invuln from throw protection to the frame meter
- Changed the Slashback window under line color to red for better clarity
- Added border to Frame Meter
- Simplified projectile ownership calculation (minor performance improvement)
- Entity (e.g. projectile) pivot positions are now drawn similar to players'
