# 1.0.1-beta
- Fixed a crash that would occur when the overlay is launched before the game has loaded any characters
- Fixed Hitboxes drawing 1 screen px too thick
- Fixed Hitboxes being drawn 8 game pixels too high
- Fixed Hitboxes that were incorrectly scaled (e.g. Justice's nukes)
- Fixed Hitboxes that were incorrectly displayed during strike invuln
- Changed the method for calculating startup to use the player's animation counter (not a permanent change).
	- Some moves transition through multiple move IDs internally (thus restarting their animation counter) so it's not 100% correct yet, but this should be consistent and handle gatlings much better
- Changed FRC windows to a hatched pattern to avoid overwritting other frame properties
- Added Throw invuln from throw protection to the frame meter
- Changed the Slashback window under line color to red for better clarity
