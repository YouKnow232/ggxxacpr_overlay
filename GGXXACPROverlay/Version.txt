#1.3.1-beta
- Hotfix for innaccurate command throw ranges
	- They were being based from player origin instead of pushbox edge
- Fixed a rare case where crouching pushboxes were being draw instead of airborne pushboxes in the event that a player had both flags

#1.3-beta
- Added support for throws
	- Throw ranges are displayed as purple boxes
	- Active frames and startup are shown on frame meter
	- Note that range-based unblockable hitgrabs such as Faust's 214H are not implemented
- Added visual legend for frame meter
- Added console window settings for frame meter pausing behavior (hitstop / super flash)
	- Labels for each frame meter setting are displayed in the top left
- Moves that adjust pushbox shape are now accounted for (e.g. Sols' 6H / Bridget 236K~K)
- Frame meter can now display up to two primary frame properties in one frame (the bottom highlight)
- Small adjustments to hitbox rendering accuracy
- Fixed a bug with Jam's parry frames that caused it to carry over into any move

# 1.2-beta
- Added new 'Movement' frame type
	- Denotes running, prejump, cancelable step dashes, and the cancelable parts of airdash/taunt/respect
- New startup implementation added
	- Should be correct as long as Frame Meter is correct
	- Doesn't fully support EX characters
- Added correct airborne collision boxes
- Frame meter is now 80 frames long from 100
- Overhauled frame meter visuals
- Improved frame meter resolution scaling
- Added display toggles in console window
- Overlay no longer displays in menus
- Overlay no longer draws on top of side bars
- Updated visuals for entity pivot
- Added some 'bad gamestate' checks that should make the frame meter more stable
- Fixed Axl parry frames being inverted
- Fixed a frame meter bug that would record the last frame of hitstop
- Fixed entity hurtboxes being displayed despite being disabled
- Fixed a bug that made it so projectiles hurtboxes weren't being recorded on the entity frame meter
- Fixed a bug that displayed disabled hitboxes during super flash
- Fixed Jam 632146S super not displaying the first active frame because it started during super flash

# 1.1-beta
- Fixed a crash that would occur when the overlay is launched before the game has loaded any characters
- Fixed Hitboxes drawing 1 screen px too thick
- Fixed Hitboxes being drawn 8 game pixels too high
- Fixed Hitboxes that were incorrectly scaled (e.g. Justice's nukes)
- Fixed Hitboxes that were incorrectly displayed during strike invuln
- Fixed Axl parry mistakenly being marked as in parry state for it's full animation. (He seems to be a unique exception for the prior parry detection logic)
- Fixed Jam parry extending parry frames past it's actual active window. (She has a unique variable for her parry. 8F active, 14F parry miss lockout)
- Changed the method for calculating startup to use the player's animation counter (startup calculation is still a WIP).
	- Some moves transition through multiple move IDs internally (thus restarting their animation counter) so it's not 100% correct yet, but this should be consistent and handle gatlings much better
	- The fundamental issue is gatlings can look identical to certain multihit moves with the information I currently have available.
- Changed FRC windows to draw a yellow line on top of the frame meter pip so as not to draw over invuln properties
- Added Throw invuln from throw protection to the frame meter
- Changed the Slashback window under line color to red for better clarity
- Added border to Frame Meter
- Simplified projectile ownership calculation (minor performance improvement)
- Entity (e.g. projectile) pivot positions are now drawn similar to players'

# 1.0-beta
- Added frame meter
- Improved memory performance

# 0.2-alpha
- Improved memory and rendering performance
- Corrected some inaccurate boxes that were supposed to be disabled by certain state flags

# 0.1-alpha
