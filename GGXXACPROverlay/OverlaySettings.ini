# This flag does two things. Disables hitboxes after coming into contact with something and hides unintentional hitboxes.
#  In some instances when spirtes are reused across animations hitbox information carries over as well.
#  These unintentional hitboxes are disabled with this flag.
#  Set this to true to see these disabled hitboxes.
