# GGXXACPROverlay
Displays hitboxes in a seamless overlay for the Steam release of Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R.

## How to Use
1. Launch Plus R
2. Launch Overlay

## Known Issues
- Some inactive hitboxes are displayed in certain attacks that reuse sprites associated with another attack animation that has an active hitbox during that sprite
  - examples are Slayer's 236D and 214X~H
- Grab ranges are not displayed
